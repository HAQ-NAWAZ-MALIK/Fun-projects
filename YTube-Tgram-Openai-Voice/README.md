This project is a Telegram bot that utilizes the OpenAI API to provide natural language processing capabilities. Users can interact with the bot by sending text messages or voice recordings, and the bot will respond with appropriate responses generated by the OpenAI language model.

## Features

- Text messaging: Users can send text messages to the bot, and the bot will respond with relevant responses generated by the OpenAI model.
- Voice messaging: Users can send voice recordings to the bot, which will be transcribed using the OpenAI Whisper model, and the bot will respond with relevant text or audio responses.
- Audio responses: The bot can generate audio responses using the OpenAI text-to-speech model, which can be sent back to the user as audio files.
